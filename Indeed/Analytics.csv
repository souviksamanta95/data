PROJECT CONTEXT
Cervical cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in India, accounting for approx. 60,000 deaths reported annually, and the primary cause of cervical cancer is the Human Papillomavirus (HPV). Cervical cancer can, however, be prevented through the HPV vaccine. The best protective effect is seen when the vaccine is administered to adolescent girls (9-14 years). Despite these benefits, the uptake of this vaccine continues to be low in India for a number of reasons.

In India, physicians display varying levels of hesitancy when it comes to recommending the HPV vaccine. This results in low awareness and poor conviction among decision-makers/parents to vaccinate their children. The objective of this project is to design interventions that reduce physician hesitancy in recommending the HPV vaccine.

In the current phase of the project, we are planning to test the effectiveness of the interventions we have designed through lab experiments. These will be conducted remotely with medical students and physicians in two phases. We are looking for a research consultant to oversee the implementation of the test phase and manage the backend data.
