Scope of Role:

The role leads a team of analysts and is responsible for labor planning activities across EU/IN Customer Fulfilment Network. The core functionality of the role is to lead the network planners and act as a Subject Matter Expert who can teach and influence all aspects of production planning tactically and strategically. The role is expected to be highly analytical, understand complex systems and influence the various stakeholders impacting labor planning, including FC Operations, Ops Finance, HR, S&OP and Workforce Staffing teams, in order to develop labor plans that are accurate and achievable across the FCs. The decisions made by this role can have a significant impact on inventory placement, associate experience and overall costs associated with how well the labor plan balances between the site and the network level constraints.

While planning and execution are critical to the role's success, the ability to communicate the short and long-term staffing strategy of the network is essential. The role is expected to develop the labor planning guidance, influence Ops Senior Leadership to commit to that guidance and then be able to communicate this guidance to hundreds of Ops, Finance and HR leaders within the FCs and monitor adherence in execution.

To do this, the role is expected to possess an analytical approach in collaboration with teams such as S&OP, Capacity, and ACES (Ops Excellence) to implement long-term strategic initiatives which improve customer and associate experience while balancing FC labor and storage constraints. The role must also recognize the ever-present challenges with accuracy of the assumptions that go into labor planning and strive for deeper understanding of inputs and variation in planning assumptions which dictate the overall short and long term staffing outputs. To achieve the automation in labor planning and systematically eliminate immaterial decision making, the role is also responsible for education and adoption of the new automated tools that are developed by the Tech teams.

Job Responsibilities include:
Lead labor planning activities in EU or IN network for all FC types
Drives creation of quality initiatives, process change initiatives and other Lean initiatives to improve the Labor Planning process which ultimately enable the network to meet and exceed business plan.
